# Auto-Differentiator
An automatic-differentiator for back propagation in neural networks.

The AutoDiff.py is the automatic differentiator that makes use of a computational graph and uses back propagation to calculate the derivate at each step of the equation. 

The included Linear Regression model utilizes the auto automatic differenctiator to accurately predict the line of best fit.

test.py shows the graph of both the inputted function and its derivative.
